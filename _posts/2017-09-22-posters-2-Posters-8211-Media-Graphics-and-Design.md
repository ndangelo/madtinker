**Whether a poster** is a promotion for an art exhibit, a musical group, or the voice of dissent, it is common to see one tacked on a wall or framed, hanging in homes and offices alongside paintings, photographs, and fine art prints. no other graphic design format has been so successful in capturing the attention and hearts of museum curators, art critics, social historians, and the public. Some people have extensive poster collections that contain either a variety of posters or a series.

*Author: Iku Okada*

“Human Rights, Human Wrongs” is a poster that allows you to chose and interpret a social issue of interest to you. You will voice your opinion in your chosen topic by creating a visual, conceptual statement using the juxtaposition of type and image.  

The poster is directed at the general public and it’s aim is to create awareness for the issue and invite the viewer to question or consider his or her point if view on the topic. To achieve this, use the medium to your advantage. The poster is a medium whose intent is to grab the attention and draw the viewer in. It can be a powerful medium when designed and executed successfully.

**Example Topic**: Child labor abuse in apparel industry, especially in brands so-called “fast-fashion”.

A graphic design solution can be a catalyst for change. If you had a chance to raise your voice in protest through a poster, what would you protest? War? Child abuse? Pollution? What would you promote? Freedom? Clean water? To whom would you appeal? Select one cause that you deem important.

---

## Sketch the Following

1. At the top of a page, write the name of the cause.  
2. Sketch or write as many objects as you can think of having similarities to your subject. If you’re having difficulty, use attribute listing to help you or treat this as a kind of a Rorschach inkblot test, where you simply sketch the first thing that comes to mind when asking yourself, “What might this remind me of or be similar to?”  
3. Sketch visual metaphors, at least two, for your cause.

With the head and torso drawn, I then illustrated the arm(s) and lower portion of the figure. I also added this adorning, flowing fabric to help imply the Buddha’s divinity and presence as a cosmic entity.

The line work made in Illustrator is printed out so I can draw on half of the first set of arms. I’m not sure yet what specific art tools I want to include in the hands, so I only draw the handles. Things can always be edited – added in or taken out.
