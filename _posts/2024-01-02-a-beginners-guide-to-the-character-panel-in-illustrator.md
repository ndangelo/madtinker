## 1. How to Open the Character Panel in Illustrator

Illustrator’s Character panel is one of the most essential instruments if you’re looking to work with text in Illustrator. Besides the classic font, size, or style attributes, it provides access to more precise text settings. In this tutorial, we’ll have a look at all the available settings, and hopefully by the end you’ll understand much better the power that you have when working with text in Illustrator.

To start, let’s learn how to show the **Character** panel in Illustrator. You can either go to **Window &gt; Type &gt; Character** or you can use the **Control-T** keyboard shortcut.

By default, you’ll have access to some of the most basic settings. To add the rest of the settings, you need to open the fly-out menu from the **Character** panel. Start by selecting **Show Options**, and then reopen the fly-out menu to enable the **Snap to Glyph** and **Font Height Options**, and also the **Touch Type Tool**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel settings](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132216/CharacterPanel1-1.jpg)</figure></div>## 2. How to Show the Character Panel in Illustrator

As long as you have a text tool selected, you can also access the **Character** panel using the **Control** panel. Go to **Window &gt; Control** if you can’t see the **Control** panel.

Simply click the **Character** text, and this will open the **Character** fly-out panel. This can be pretty useful when you need to make some quick text adjustments.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel control panel](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132217/CharacterPanel1A.jpg)</figure></div>## 3. How to Browse and Preview Fonts Using the Character Panel in Illustrator

### Step 1

Focus on the **Character** panel, and let’s start with the font. Just click that arrow button to open the **Fonts** list. At the top of the list you’ll find the recently selected fonts **(6)**, and below this list you have the variable fonts. Then the list continues with the rest of the fonts.

On the left side **(1)**, you have the name of the font, and between parentheses is the number of available styles. You can click that arrow button on the left-hand side to have a look at all the available styles.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel fonts](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132219/CharacterPanel2.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

Next, you have a preview of the font **(2)**. If you can’t see it, you need to open the fly-out menu from the **Character** panel and **Enable in-menu font previews**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel font preview](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132220/CharacterPanel2A.jpg)</figure></div>Use that wavy button **(3)** to quickly view similar fonts. Remember to click that **Back** button to remove the filter and return to the entire list of fonts.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel similar font](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132221/CharacterPanel2B.jpg)</figure></div>Using the star buttons **(4)**, you can easily save fonts as favorites or remove them from the favorites list.

On the right-hand side **(5)**, you have a series of icons which indicate the type of the font: OpenType, Variable, TrueType, SVG, or Activated Adobe Font.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel font type](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132222/CharacterPanel2C.jpg)</figure></div>## 4. How to Filter Fonts Using the Character Panel in Adobe Illustrator

If you have hundreds of fonts installed, it might be a bit of a hassle to find the font that you like. Using the Filters, you can easily narrow down the list. First of all, if you know the name of the font, you can type the name in the font field and it will show up in the list.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel  font filter](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132223/CharacterPanel3.jpg)</figure></div>Click the **Find More** tab **(1)**, and you can scroll through the fonts that Adobe provides. Once you find a font that you like, click that **Activate** button on the right-hand side, and the font can be used in your design.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel activate font](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132224/CharacterPanel3A.jpg)</figure></div>Moving to the **Filters** section, using the first button **(2)** you can filter your fonts by classification and properties. Just check the settings that interest you, and the list of available fonts will update accordingly.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel filter font](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132225/CharacterPanel3B.jpg)</figure></div>Click the star button **(3)** from the **Filters** section whenever you want to view only the fonts that you marked as favorites.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel favorite font](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132226/CharacterPanel3C.jpg)</figure></div>The next two buttons from the **Filters** section can be used to only view the recently added fonts **(4)** or the activated fonts **(5)**. Keep in mind that you can combine these filters to narrow down the list of fonts as much as possible. Remember to click that **Clear All** button whenever you wish to remove all the filters.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel recent font](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132227/CharacterPanel3D.jpg)</figure></div>Moving to the dropdown menu **(6)**, this can be used to set the look of the font preview. By default, it will show a preview with your selected text. If you don’t have any text selected, it will show a preview of the text “Sample”. Feel free to select one of the other preview options if you prefer to view the capital letters from a font, the numbers, or the symbols.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel font text preview](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132228/CharacterPanel3E.jpg)</figure></div>Finally, using the three buttons from the right-hand **(7)** side, you can adjust the size of the font sample.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel text preview size](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132229/CharacterPanel3F.jpg)</figure></div>## 5. How to Set the Font Style Using the Character Panel in Adobe Illustrator

If a font has more than one style, you can change it from the **Font Style** menu.

Selecting a variable font will also give you access to the **Variable Font** settings. Just click the button and minutely adjust your font using those sliders.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel variable font](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132230/CharacterPanel4.jpg)</figure></div>## 6. How to Set the Font Height Reference Using the Character Panel in Illustrator

Next, you have the **Font Height Reference** menu. The default **Em Box** displays the font size including the height of the bounding box around the font.

Select **Cap Height** to adjust the font size in reference to the uppercase letters. **x-Height** sets the font size with reference to the lowercase letters, such as x. Finally, use **ICF box** to set the font size with reference to the ICF box. This applies in general for CJK fonts.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character panel font height reference](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132230/CharacterPanel5.jpg)</figure></div>## 7. How to Set the Font Size Using Adobe Illustrator’s Character Panel

### Step 1

Moving to the next set of settings, you can use these buttons to change the size of the text, increase or decrease the space between paragraphs, edit the kerning in Illustrator, or adjust the leading in Illustrator.

Let’s start by seeing how you can adjust the font size using Illustrator’s **Character** panel.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![character panel font size](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132232/CharacterPanel6.jpg)</figure>### Step 2

First, you can click that arrow button and select one of the preset font size values.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![font size preset](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132232/CharacterPanel6A.gif)</figure></div>### Step 3

Using the tiny arrow buttons, you can increase or decrease the font size by **1 px**. Hold down the **Shift** key as you click these buttons to increase or decrease the size by **10 px**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![font size increments](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132233/CharacterPanel6B.gif)</figure></div>### Step 4

Click the font size icon to quickly select the existing value, and press the up or down arrow buttons to increase or decrease the font size by **1 px**. Again, you can also hold down the **Shift** key as you press the arrow buttons to increase or decrease the size by **10 px**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![font size arrow button](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132234/CharacterPanel6C.gif)</figure></div>### Step 5

Finally, you can select the existing font size and type in the new value. Keep in mind that any of these techniques can also be used to adjust the leading, kerning, tracking, vertical or horizontal scale, baseline shift, and rotation.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![font size custom](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132235/CharacterPanel6D.gif)</figure></div>## 8. How to Adjust the Leading in Illustrator

### Step 1

**Leading** is the distance measured from the baseline of one line of text to the baseline of the line above it. A **baseline** is the invisible line on which letters sit. Let’s see how you can adjust the leading in Illustrator.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![baseline leading](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132236/CharacterPanel7.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

You can find the leading settings on the right-hand side of the font size settings. To edit the leading in Illustrator, you can use the same techniques that we used to adjust the font size.

**Double-click** the **Leading** icon from the **Character** panel whenever you wish to quickly change the leading value with the same value that’s used for the font size.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![leading size equal](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132237/CharacterPanel7A.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

Alternatively, you can use a keyboard shortcut to edit the leading in Illustrator. Select your text and press **Alt-Up Arrow** or **Alt-Down Arrow** to decrease or increase the leading value by **2 px**. Pressing **Control-Alt-Up Arrow** or **Control-Alt-Down Arrow** will decrease or increase the leading value by **10 px**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![leading keyboard shortcut](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132238/CharacterPanel7B.gif)</figure></div>### Step 4

You can also set custom leading settings for specific lines of text from a paragraph. Use the **Type Tool** to select one or more lines of text from a paragraph and adjust the leading in Illustrator’s Character panel.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![leading paragraph](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132239/CharacterPanel7C.jpg)</figure></div>## 9. How to Adjust the Kerning in Illustrator

### Step 1

Using **Kerning** in Illustrator, you can adjust the spacing between specific pairs of letters. You can find the kerning settings below the font size settings.

Select a piece of text and make sure that the **Type Tool (T)** is active before you start kerning text in Illustrator. Click between two letters, focus on the **Kerning** box, and edit the existing value, thus adjusting the spacing between those two letters. When kerning is set to **Auto** (Metric kerning), the value appears between parentheses.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![kerning illustrator](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132240/CharacterPanel8.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

Metric kerning (Auto) is the default one, and it uses the kerning settings that come with most fonts. These settings set specific spacing values for particular combinations of letters, the most common being LA, P., To, Try, Ta, Tu, Te, Ty, Wa, WA, We, Wo, Ya, and Yo.

Optical kerning adjusts the letter spacing in Illustrator based on their shapes. This can be useful when you’re using a font that lacks built‑in kerning, or if you use several typefaces or sizes in your text.

Manual kerning is in your hands. Just click between the letters in your text and adjust the kerning values as you wish.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![kerning presets](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132241/CharacterPanel8A.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

Kerning text in Illustrator can also be done using keyboard shortcuts. Click between the pair of letters and press **Alt-Right Arrow** or **Alt-Left Arrow** to increase or decrease the kerning by **20**. Pressing **Control-Alt-Right Arrow** or **Control-Alt-Left Arrow** will increase or decrease the tracking by **100**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![kerning keyboard shortcut](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132242/CharacterPanel8B.gif)</figure></div>## 10. How to Change the Space Between Letters in Illustrator Using Tracking

### Step 1

Using **Tracking**, you can change the space between letters in Adobe Illustrator. You can find the tracking settings below the leading settings.

Select a piece of text, focus on the **Tracking** settings, and edit the existing value to easily adjust the font spacing in Illustrator.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![tracking illustrator](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132243/CharacterPanel9.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

As with kerning, you can use a keyboard shortcut to change the space between letters in Adobe Illustrator. Select your text and press **Alt-Shift-Right Arrow** or **Alt-Shift-Left Arrow** to increase or decrease the font spacing in Illustrator by **20**. Pressing **Control-Alt-Shift-Right Arrow** or **Control-Alt-Shift-Left Arrow** will increase or decrease the tracking by **100**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![tracking keyboard shortcut](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132244/CharacterPanel9A.gif)</figure></div>### Step 3

You can also set custom tracking settings for specific characters from a word. Use the **Type Tool** to select one or more characters from a word and adjust the tracking value in the **Character** panel.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![tracking characters](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132245/CharacterPanel9B.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 4

Tracking and kerning go hand in hand, so feel free to combine these settings to meticulously change the space between letters in Adobe Illustrator.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![kerning tracking](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132246/CharacterPanel9C.jpg)</figure></div>## 11. How to Scale Text Using the Character Panel in Illustrator

The **Vertical** and **Horizontal Scale** settings can be used to scale text in Illustrator. You can find these settings below the kerning and tracking attributes.

Use the percentage values to scale your selected text relative to the existing text settings.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![horizontal vertical scale text illustrator](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132247/CharacterPanel10.jpg)</figure></div>## 12. How to Change the Baseline Shift in Illustrator

### Step 1

A **baseline** is the invisible line on which letters sit. Using baseline shift in Adobe Illustrator, you can move the entire text or selected letters up or down relative to the baseline. But where is **Baseline Shift** in Illustrator? You can find it right below the **Vertical Scale** setting inside the **Character** panel.

Select a piece of text or use the **Type Tool (T)** to select a part of that text, focus on the **Baseline Shift** setting, and edit the existing value to move the selection relative to the baseline.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![baseline shift illustrator](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132248/CharacterPanel11.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

Alternatively, you can use a keyboard shortcut to adjust the baseline shift in Illustrator. Select your text and press **Alt-Shift-Up Arrow** or **Alt-Shift-Down Arrow** to increase or decrease the baseline shift by **2 px**. Pressing **Control-Alt-Shift-Up Arrow** or **Control-Alt-Shift-Down Arrow** will increase or decrease the baseline shift by **10 px**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![baseline shift keyboard shortcut](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132249/CharacterPanel11A.gif)</figure></div>### Step 3

Baseline shift can be particularly useful when you’re working with text on a path as it provides a pretty quick way for you to align and move text along that path.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![baseline shift text path](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132250/CharacterPanel11B.jpg)</figure></div>## 13. How to Rotate Text Using the Character Panel in Adobe Illustrator

### Step 1

Using the **Character Rotation** settings, you can easily rotate letters from a text. All you have to do is select a piece of text and set the angle. This will independently rotate each letter in your text.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![letter rotation illustrator](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132251/CharacterPanel12.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

To rotate just a particular letter from your text, use the **Type Tool (T)** to select it and then set the **Rotation** angle.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![character rotation illustrator](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132252/CharacterPanel12A.jpg)</figure></div>## 14. How to Capitalize Text in Illustrator

Using the **All Caps** and **Small Caps** button from the **Character** panel, you can easily make text caps in Illustrator.

Select a piece of text or parts of it and simply click the **All Caps** button to turn the lowercase letters into capital letters.

Small caps are lowercase characters that resemble the uppercase letters but are reduced in size, close to the lowercase letters. Again, select a piece of text or parts of it, and just click the **Small Caps** buttons to easily turn the lowercase letters into small caps.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![all caps small caps illustrator](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132253/CharacterPanel13.jpg)</figure></div>## 15. How to Do Superscript in Adobe Illustrator

**Superscript** is a piece of text reduced in size in relation to the existing font size and raised in relation to the baseline.

Use the **Type Tool (T)** to select letters from your text, and simply click the **Superscript** button from the **Character** panel to turn the selected text into superscript.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![superscript illustrator](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132254/CharacterPanel14.jpg)</figure></div>## 16. How to Do Subscript in Illustrator

**Subscript** is a piece of text reduced in size in relation to the existing font size and lowered in relation to the baseline.

To create subscript text in Adobe Illustrator, pick the **Type Tool (T)** and use it to select the letters that you want to turn into subscript. Just click the **Subscript** button from the **Character** panel to turn the selected text into subscript.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![subscript illustrator](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132255/CharacterPanel15.jpg)</figure></div>## 17. How to Underline or Strikethrough Text Using the Character Panel

The **Underline** and **Strikethrough** buttons are pretty self-explanatory. Select some text or parts of it using the **Type Tool (T)**, and just click those two buttons whenever you wish to underline or strikethrough that selection.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![underline strikethrough illustrator](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132256/CharacterPanel16.jpg)</figure></div>## 18. How to Set the Hyphenation Language and the Anti-Aliasing Method

### Step 1

Using the **Language** drop-down menu, you can set the hyphenation language for any piece of text.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator hyphenation language](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132257/CharacterPanel17.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

Next to the **Language** setting, you have the **Anti-Aliasing** method, which is set to **Sharp** by default. This feature can be helpful if you’re planning to save the text as a rasterized image.

First, go to **View &gt; Pixel Preview** to see how your text will look once it’s rasterized. Using one of the **Anti-Aliasing** methods, you can smoothen out the appearance of those curvy edges. Generally, the default **Sharp** anti-aliasing is the ideal option so you won’t have to mess with the other settings.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator anti-aliasing text](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132258/CharacterPanel18.jpg)</figure></div>## 19. How to Use Glyphs and the OpenType Panel in Illustrator

### Step 1

Besides the default letter designs, fonts can include additional characters which are called glyphs.

For example, the “h” lowercase from this [Collina Regular font](https://elements.envato.com/collina-ligature-serif-font-7NHJ52C) comes with two glyph alternatives. Use the **Type Tool (T)** or the **Touch Type Tool (Shift-T)** to select just one letter from the text and a small menu below the selection will let you know if that character has glyph alternatives.

Using the **Glyphs** panel (**Window &gt; Type &gt; Glyphs**) you can view all available glyphs for each font. Use the **Show** drop-down menu to filter the existing glyphs, and just double-click a glyph to insert it in your selected text.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator glyph](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132259/CharacterPanel19.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

The type and number of available glyphs vary from font to font. The **Glyphs** panel can be useful when you want to insert a few glyphs, but if you need to activate a specific set of glyphs for an entire paragraph, the **OpenType** panel (**Window &gt; Type &gt; OpenType**) is a much better solution. Using the buttons from the bottom of this panel, you’ll be able to easily activate or deactivate the available sets of glyphs for any OpenType font.

First, you have the **Standard Ligatures**. Ligatures are additional replacement characters for certain letter combos, such as fi, fl, ff, ffi, ffl, aff, and many more.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator standard ligatures](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132300/CharacterPanel20.gif)</figure></div>Next, you have **Contextual Alternates** which glue together certain letters, giving your text a better flow.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator contextual alternates](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132301/CharacterPanel20A.gif)</figure></div>Besides the **Standard Ligatures**, some fonts also include **Discretionary Ligatures** for letter pairs such as ct, st, and ft.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator discretionary ligatures](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132302/CharacterPanel20B.gif)</figure></div>**Swashes** are decorations that embellish characters. These are generally added at the beginning or end of a word.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator swashes](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132303/CharacterPanel20C.gif)</figure></div>Use **Stylistic Alternates** to stylize the font. Although it’s not a rule, most of the time, this will replace a double-storey “a” with a single-storey “a” and adjust the look for most of the vowels.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator stylistic alternates](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132304/CharacterPanel20D.gif)</figure></div>As the name implies, **Titling Alternates** are mostly for titling. Titling fonts are usually all caps fonts designed specifically for headlines or display usage. Using **Titling Alternates**, you can further decorate such fonts.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator titling alternates](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132304/CharacterPanel20E.gif)</figure></div>If the font makes it available, the **Ordinals** button can be another method that you can use to insert a superscript in Adobe Illustrator. It can be a bit of a time saver as it adds more than one superscript with only one click.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator ordinals](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132305/CharacterPanel20F.gif)</figure></div>If you’re working with fractions and the font allows it, you can use this **Fractions** button to nicely nest the numbers on top of one another.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator fractions](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132306/CharacterPanel20G.gif)</figure></div>Finally, you can activate specific style sets using the Stylistic Sets button. Depending on the font, the names of these sets might help you understand what will change with each stylistic set that you enable.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator stylistic sets](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132307/CharacterPanel20H.gif)</figure></div>### Step 3

When the font allows it, you can use the **Figure** drop-down menu to particularly style the numbers.

Select **Tabular Lining** to use full-height numbers of the same width. This can be useful when you need to align numbers in columns perfectly. **Proportional Oldstyle** will create numbers that have varying heights and widths. Select **Proportional Lining** to use full-height numbers with varying widths or **Tabular Oldstyle** for numbers with equal widths but varying heights.

When available in the font, you can use the **Superscript/Superior** or the **Numerator** settings to insert different variations of a superscript in Adobe Illustrator.

### Step 1

Now that you know everything you need to know about glyphs and Illustrator’s OpenType panel, let’s get back to the **Character** panel and see how you can use the **Snap to Glyph** settings.

Most importantly, you need to go to **View** in the menu bar to enable the **Smart Guides** and **Snap to Glyph**. Keep in mind that **Snap to Glyph** won’t work when the **Snap to Grid** is enabled, if the **Alignment Guides** are disabled (**Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Smart Guides**), or when the **Snapping Tolerance** is set to 0.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator snap glyph](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132311/CharacterPanel19A.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

Enable the first one whenever you wish to snap to the **baseline** of glyphs while drawing, moving, or scaling an object. The glyph guides will appear on the text when you draw, scale, rotate, or move objects.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![snap glyph baseline](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132312/CharacterPanel19B.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

Enable the second one to snap to the **height** of lowercase glyphs (x, z, v, w) while drawing, moving, or scaling an object.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![snap glyph height](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132313/CharacterPanel19C.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 4

When you use the **Glyph Bounds** setting, the glyph guides will appear on the left, right, top, and bottom of glyphs.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![snap glyph bounds](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132314/CharacterPanel19D.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 5

The **Proximity Guides** will generate guides near the baseline, x-height, and glyph bound.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![snap glyph proximity guides](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132315/CharacterPanel19E.jpg)</figure></div>Obviously, you can enable more than one of these snap features to easily align your shapes with the glyph edges.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![illustrator snap glyph](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132316/CharacterPanel19D2.gif)</figure></div>### Step 6

Additionally, you can isolate a character to generate guides solely around it. Pick the **Selection Tool (V)**, **right-click** a letter from your text, and select **Snap to Glyph \[symbol\]**.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![isolate glyph](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132317/CharacterPanel19F.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 7

Remember to isolate a character whenever you wish to use the **Angular Guides**. Using this feature, you can snap to the angles of glyphs while drawing, moving, or scaling objects.

To release an isolated character, you can either **right-click** it and select **Release Snap to Glyph** or you can click the **Release Glyph** button from the control panel.

Finally, using the **Anchor Point** setting, you can snap to the anchor points of a glyph while drawing. This can be pretty useful if you need to decorate a font.

Pressing the **Touch Type Tool** button from the **Character** panel will activate this amazing tool. Alternatively, you can press **Shift-T** to activate it.

Click any character from a text to select it, use the round handle to rotate the character, and click and drag to move it wherever you wish.

### Step 1

Now that you understand all the settings from the **Character** panel, let’s have a look at the remaining commands from the fly-out menu. Open it, and we’ll start with the **Standard Vertical Roman Alignment** features.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![standard vertical roman alignment](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132321/CharacterPanel22.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 2

Besides the buttons from the **Character** panel, you can also use the commands from the fly-out menu to add text caps in Illustrator, or to insert superscript and subscript in Illustrator.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![caps superscript subscript](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132322/CharacterPanel23.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 3

By default, the **Fractional Widths** feature is enabled. It varies the spacing between characters and sometimes uses only fractions of whole pixels.

The only time when you might need to disable it is when you set the font size to be really small. Keeping the **Fractional Widths** enabled might cause the text to overlap or have too much extra space.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![fractional widths](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132323/CharacterPanel24.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 4

To make sure that a word won’t break into syllables, select it and select **No Break** from the fly-out menu of the **Character** panel.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![no break text illustrator](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2024/01/02132324/CharacterPanel25.jpg)</figure></div>### Step 5

Select **Reset Panel** from the fly-out menu of the **Character** panel whenever you wish to replace the existing settings with the default ones.

To adjust the default **Character** panel settings, you need to go to the **Character Styles** panel (**Window &gt; Type &gt; Character Styles**), open the fly-out menu, and go to **Character Style Options**.

You can start with the **Basic Character Formats** to adjust the main settings, and remember to click the **OK** button when you’re done.

Once you’ve created a text style that you like, you might want to save it or apply it to other text. You can do this easily using character styles in Illustrator.

Make sure that your text is selected, focus on the **Character Styles** panel, and simply click the **Create New Style** button to save the style of your selected text. Now, select another piece of text and just click your saved style to instantly apply all those text settings.
