<span class="blog-post-lead">Scope your work and break it down into manageable components; then schedule and assign the tasks needed to complete your project.</span> You can also use this template to manage workloads and tasks as changes occur. A project plan template is the foundation of all the work you do in leading a project to a successful completion.

Now that you have downloaded the free project plan template you are ready to get your project on track to a successful completion. That is because the project plan is the fundamental document from which your project is formally managed.

The project plan is made up of activities, tasks and the resources needed to complete the project as outlined in the project business case. So, you want to have a description of the major phases of the project, a schedule of activities, tasks and their duration, dependencies, resources, timeframes, etc. Then list the assumptions and constraints in the planning process.

When you are creating a project plan you need to take the following steps: note project scope, identify milestones and tasks, quantify the effort required, allocate the resources, make a schedule, list dependencies and document it all for approval.

While the business case that you have composed earlier in the project process may have offered a general view of the project, now the project plan will go into greater detail once the project scope and charter have been formalized and a team hired. You write the project plan during the [project planning phase](https://www.projectmanager.com/software/planning), but it doesn’t stay on a shelf or in a drawer once complete. This is a living document that will be revisited and referred to throughout the life cycle of the project.

Follow these steps to make sure that your project plan takes all aspects of the project into account. That way you will be less likely to run into surprises that you have not planned for.

### 1. Planning Basis

Begin with the scope. What activities and tasks as defined in your project must be done in order to make the project a success? Use the project charter as a springboard.

Now you want to note the milestones or major events or phases in your project, and collect them in a chart with three columns for the milestone, a description and its delivery date. Examples of milestones are when the business case is approved, when the project team is appointed or the project office established.

The next step is detailing the phases of the project, which is defined as a set of activities, such as the project’s initiation, planning, execution and closure. These should also be noted in a chart with the phase followed by a description of it and its sequence.

You need to note the tasks that are necessary to complete the project, too. These are called activities and can include when you develop a quality plan, formulate supplier contracts and perform project closure. Write them out in a chart listing the phase, activity, description and sequence.

Going deeper now into tasks, you want to list the items of work that need completion within the project. List them in a chart, again, noting the phase, activity, task and sequence.

This leads to the effort likely needed to complete the above tasks. List the task with the amount of time you believe necessary to finish the task. This in turn goes hand in glove with resources, so you want to take the task and attach a resource or team member to it. This is the person responsible for completing the task.
