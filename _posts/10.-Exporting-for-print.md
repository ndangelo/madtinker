**Your document’s ready and proofed, now it’s time to export it as a print-ready document for the press. Read on to learn how to create a print-ready product every time that will keep your printer happy…**

Different printers have different preferences for how they would like to receive documents for printing from their customers. Some provide templates, some specify bleed settings (see Page 4), some will request the native packaged InDesign files (which can be risky if you’d rather not have anyone alter your file) and some are happy to receive a print-ready PDF.

Here we look at how you can produce the latter – a <span style="color: #993366;">**print-ready PDF** </span>with printer’s marks, which usually works a treat.

Once you’ve preflighted your document (see Page 12) and checked for spelling errors, you are ready to export for print.

Go to **File &gt; Export**. You will be prompted to save the exported file in a location on your computer and to give it a name.

From the **Format** drop-down options at the bottom of the window select **Adobe PDF (Print)** and click **Save**.

Click on **Marks and Bleeds**.

Unless your printer has specified only some marks to be included, under Marks check **All Printer’s Marks** to highlight all the options below it.

Under **Bleed and Slug** check Use **Document Bleed** **Settings**. If you have included a **Bleed** (see Page 4), as recommended if you have any elements or colors which cross the edges of pages, the bleed’s dimensions will appear in the window.

Click **Export** at the bottom right of the window (check the **View PDF after Exporting** box under **General** to view the result immediately) and you’re done!
