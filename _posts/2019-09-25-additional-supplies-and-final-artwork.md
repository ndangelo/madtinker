**<span style="color: #800000;">Again, I’m sorry for having missed class today. September 25th, 2019.</span>**

I would like the class to begin production on finished pictures. I am recommending an 11×14 pad. It is bigger than what most of you are currently using.

Here is a good example of the type of pad I’m looking for:

[https://www.amazon.com/Strathmore-400-5-STR-400-5-Sheet-Drawing/dp/B000A7OPAO/ref=sr\_1\_36?keywords=drawing+pads&amp;qid=1569419709&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-36](https://www.amazon.com/Strathmore-400-5-STR-400-5-Sheet-Drawing/dp/B000A7OPAO/ref=sr_1_36?keywords=drawing+pads&qid=1569419709&s=gateway&sr=8-36)

Strathmore (400-5) STR-400-5 24 Sheet No.80 Drawing Pad, 11 by 14″, 11″x14″, Cream

It’s only 25 sheets, so all test, sketches and doodles should be completed in your sketchbook.

I will have 2 Assignments for you to pick from for the midterm. I will give a brief lecture regarding these two projects.

We have a lot to get accomplished but I think there will be plenty of time to get some finished work completed.

Optional Supplies: Here is a link to some affordable colored pencils:

[https://www.amazon.com/Artlicious-Premium-Distinct-Coloring-Sharpener/dp/B01FIWU46Y/ref=sr\_1\_15?crid=2NA6IBRKXWQ24&amp;keywords=colored+pencils&amp;qid=1569420811&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=colored+%2Caps%2C231&amp;sr=8-15](https://www.amazon.com/Artlicious-Premium-Distinct-Coloring-Sharpener/dp/B01FIWU46Y/ref=sr_1_15?crid=2NA6IBRKXWQ24&keywords=colored+pencils&qid=1569420811&s=gateway&sprefix=colored+%2Caps%2C231&sr=8-15)

Get the 9.99$ version. The most expensive option is colored pencils for watercolor. We don’t need that.

Best,

Nick
