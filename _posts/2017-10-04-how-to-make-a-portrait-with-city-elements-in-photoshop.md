[Cloud Brushes (Download a few from the list)](http://www.deviantart.com/browse/all/resources/applications/psbrushes/?q=clouds)

### Step 1

Create a new document sized 907px\*1380px with white background. Load the model into Photoshop. Cut out the model and paste it to our document:

![1 paste]()

Use a cloud brush you downloaded as eraser, go through the hair, shoulder region of the model as shown below:

![1 erase 2]()

Also use a soft eraser to remove the bottom right part of the model – we will place a few elements inside this later on:

![1 erase]()

### Step 2

Apply the following adjustment layers as clipping masks for the model layer created in the previous step:

Black and White

![2 bw]()

On the layer mask of the black and white adjustment layer, use the splatter brush as eraser, remove some parts around the face and fingers as shown below:

![2 bw mask]()

![2 bw mask 2]()

Curves

![2 curves]()

And here is the effect so far:

![2 effect]()

Create a new layer below the model layer, use the cloud brush to paint some cloudy effect as shown below:

![2 cloud]()

### Step 3

Load the “City Stock 1” image into Photoshop, select the red building from the image:

![3 sel]()

Copy and paste the building below the in between the model layer and the cloud layer, resize it to fit our canvas size. Reduce its layer opacity to around 80%:

![3 paste]()

Use the Splatter Brush as eraser, remove some parts of the city building as shown below:

![3 erase]()

Apply the following image adjustment layers as clip masks for this building layer:

Black and White

![3 bw]()

Levels

![3 lvs]()

Curves

![3 curves]()

Here is the effect so far:

![3 effect]()

### Step 4

Load the “City Stock 2” into Photoshop and select the following building:

![4 build]()

Copy and paste the building into the following area of our canvas, use free transform tool and eraser tool to fit the building into the model’s body shape:

![4 paste]()

Apply the following adjustment layers to this building layer:

Black and white

![4 bw]()

Levels

![4 lvs]()

and here is the effect so far:

![4 effect]()

### Step 5

Load the “City Stock 3” image into Photoshop, select the road part with the direction sign:

![5 road]()

Copy and paste the selection to our document and put it below the model layer, use the free transform to adjust its shape:

![5 paste]()

Apply the following image adjustments to this road layer:

Black and White

![5 bw]()

Levels

![5 lvs]()

Curves

![5 curves]()

and you will have the following effect:

[![5 effect]()](http://www.psdvault.com/img/2016/06/5-effect.jpg)

### Step 6

We will be adding a couple traffic lights and street signs to our image. Go to “City stock 1” and select the following traffic light:

![6 sel traf]()

Copy and paste the selection to our document, re-size and place it over to the city street:

![6 paste]()

Apply the following image adjustments to this traffic light:

Curves

![6 curves]()

Levels

![6 lvs]()

and here is the effect:

![6 effect]()

Go to “City stock 3” image and select the following street lamp and advertisement:

![6 sel 2]()

Copy and paste it to our document and apply the following image adjustments:

Black and white

![6 bw 2]()

Levels

![6 lvs 2]()

Attach this element to the model as shown below:

[![6 effect 2]()](http://www.psdvault.com/img/2016/06/6-effect-2.jpg)

### Step 7

We’re almost done! To finalise this photo manipulation, I added a couple of image adjustment layers on top to give it some colour:

Selective Color

![7 reds]()

![7 whites]()

![7 neu]()

![7 blacks]()

Vibrance

![7 vib]()

and here is my final effect: (click to enlarge)
