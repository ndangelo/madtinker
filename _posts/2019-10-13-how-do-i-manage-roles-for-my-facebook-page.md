I will need to be made an administrator of your Facebook page. Please invite me: the class facebook page is <https://www.facebook.com/cendeavorslab/>

You’ll need to be an admin to manage roles for your Page. Learn how to [see what your role is](https://www.facebook.com/help/510247025775149). There’s no limit to the number of people who can have a role on a Page. Learn more about [what each Page role can do](https://www.facebook.com/help/289207354498410).  
Give Someone a Role If you’re an admin:

1. Click **Settings** at the top of your Page.
2. Click **Page Roles** in the left column.
3. Type a name or email in the box and select the person from the list that appears.
4. Click **Editor** to select a role from the dropdown menu.
5. Click **Add** and enter your password to confirm.

Keep in mind that if you’re not friends with the person you’re adding, they’ll have to [accept your invite](https://www.facebook.com/help/1021117938014211) before they can start helping you manage your Page. So you will have to send me a friend invite.

Please send invite me as a friend and then as an admin before Monday’s class.
