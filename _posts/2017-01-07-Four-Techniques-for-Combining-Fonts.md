[Sentinel](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100034&affiliateID=63&track=003) with [Tungsten](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100035&affiliateID=63&track=004) and [Verlag](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100009&affiliateID=63&track=005)

Is there a way to know what fonts will work together? Building a palette is an intuitive process, but expanding a typographic duet to three, four, or even five voices can be daunting. Here are four tips for navigating the typographic ocean, all built around H&amp;FJ’s Highly Scientific First Principle of Combining Fonts: keep one thing consistent, and let one thing vary.

It’s the interplay between fonts that gives them energy. The more distant the moods in a typographic palette, the friskier the design will be. Here, three fonts with distinctive silhouettes have been chosen for their contrasting dispositions: the unabashed toughness of [Tungsten](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100035&affiliateID=63&track=006) is a foil for both [Archer’s](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100033&affiliateID=63&track=007) sweetness, and the cheekiness of [Gotham Rounded](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100030&affiliateID=63&track=008).

Three type families with nineteenth century roots, thrown together in a cheerful typographic riot. Choosing type families with different features helps prevent redundancy: here, the brawny variations of [The Proteus Project](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100019&affiliateID=63&track=015) are reserved for headings, [Sentinel’s](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100034&affiliateID=63&track=016) six weights of romans and italics recommend it to text, and [Knockout’s](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013&affiliateID=63&track=017) nine different widths helps the sans serif fill in the cracks.

What do a neoclassical modern, a suave sans serif, and a sporty slab have in common? All are meditations on precision, though each has a different texture. [H&amp;FJ Didot](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100004&affiliateID=63&track=024) achieves its crispness through the thinnest possible serifs, [Verlag](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100009&affiliateID=63&track=025) through its insistently geometric motifs, and our new [Vitesse](http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100036&affiliateID=63&track=026) typeface through its pairing of machined edges and racy curves. Together, these three mechanical faces create a dramatic typographical tension.
