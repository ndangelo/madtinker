## ANALYZING BOOK JACKETS AND MAGAZINE COVERS

### Find three examples of book jackets that express the spirit or personality of their Contents. Justify your choices.

## BOOK COVER DESIGN SERIES

### Step 1

1. Select three books written by different authors. Each book should be from a different time. 

    - **1. 1980 – 2023**
    - **2. 1920 – 1960**
    - **3. 1880 – 1900**

2. Read their works. Research them. How do these books fit together? How do they differ? Be very specific! Example: Your theme shouldn’t be “anger”

3. Write an objective statement. Define the purpose and function of the problem, the audience for the books, and the information to be communicated. **The statement should be at least** 1 1/2 pages. (discuss all three and the common thread **between the books.**)

### Step 2

1. **Create two small sketches for each book cover. Two for each writer in your series.** Sketch the front covers and spines as well.

2. The covers must be similar in style and yet express the individuality of each writer.

3. Create a publisher’s logo on each cover in the same position.

4. Your solution may be purely typographic or visually driven

5. Think about the various ways the series could be tied together through the use of similar visuals: illustrations, graphics, photographs, typography

6. After you have completed the above tasks, submit one or multiple pdfs containing the above content.

7. Name the series.

8. Design a logo for the book series.

### Step 3

1. Design the final **three book covers—one for each writer in your series.** Design front covers and spines.

2. I will review your first book covers before you proceed with the others.

Please use Adobe Indesign. You can use Illustrator and Photoshop to create most of the design elements.

## **The final deliverables for this project should include:**

- A full spread for each book cover in pdf format.

- Create at least one “3d” or book-in-environment pdfs for each book. The link to some templates are on the blog.
