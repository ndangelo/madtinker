##  **DESCRIPTION**

Twitter is a powerful force in our society. While its focus is short bursts of words, those words are nearly always displayed in the same font, at the same size, with very little formatting. Your goal with this project is to turn one text-based tweet into a visually striking display that better communicates its message.

Choose a tweet—from anyone, anytime—and submit it to me for approval no later than the beginning of class on Wednesday, Sep. 23. Then, take that text and arrange the words within an 8”x10” space using only black, white, and shades of gray. You must use two typefaces (e.g.: Comic Sans, Papyrus, Papyrus Bold would be two typefaces even though it’s three fonts) that complement or contrast in a harmonious way.

You can get creative with your type if you want, using varying sizes, weights, directions, etc. But you cannot stretch, squeeze, or otherwise distort the type.

## **CONSIDERATIONS**

Will you divide the text into sections to emphasize certain words or phrases?

How will you use hierarchy tools to emphasize or to deemphasize?

Is the tweet funny? Sweet? Serious? Sarcastic? Intense? Subtle?

What typefaces will help reinforce the tone of the tweet?

NOTE: No offensive or distasteful tweets will be approved. You’re going to read this tweet hundreds of times for the next two weeks—choose something you’re excited to see!
