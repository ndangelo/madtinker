At first, logo designing seems like a fairly simple skill to acquire. But, that’s only until you get started on designing one! As David Airey puts it in his book –*Logo Design Love*,

> “Anyone can design a logo, but not everyone can design the right logo”

A logo is not just an image, but also an introduction to a brand. And since first impressions matter, it is important to design a logo that inspires brand trust, loyalty and admiration. Here are 5 important characteristics of an impactful and effective logo design:

## Original:

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/04/19135212/original1.jpg)</figure>[](https://d3ui957tjb5bqd.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/09/original.jpg)  
Imitation is the best form of flattery, however this is not the case when it comes to logo design. A good logo aids in creating a unique visual identity for a brand and helps it to stand out in a sea of competitors. While there is nothing wrong in taking a little design inspiration while creating a logo, it is important to push to be creative and as original as possible.

## Relevant:

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/04/19135227/relevant1.jpg)</figure>[](https://d3ui957tjb5bqd.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/09/relevant.jpg)  
Sometimes, even the most beautiful and unique logos may not be successful. Why? Because they may not be appropriate for their intended audience. For example, using a playful, child-like font is great for a logo for a toys company, but for a bank? Not so much. Its important to research a brand’s mission, values and its target audience before designing a logo – this will ensure that the logo is appropriate and effective for the brand.

## Versatile:

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/04/19135311/versatile1.jpg)</figure>[](https://d3ui957tjb5bqd.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/09/versatile.jpg)  
From large banners and billboards to something small like business cards and websites, typically a logo will be put to several uses. So it is important to create a scalable logo that is legible and maintains detail at all sizes. Also, a great logo is versatile in terms of color – it should look great in black and white, as well as in color as the contrast will help emphasize the idea. A few things to consider while designing a versatile logo are:

- Will the logo look good in reverse color? (light logo on a dark background)
- Will the logo be clear when sized to fit a postal stamp or favicon?
- Will the logo be clear when sized to fit a billboard?
- Will the logo be effective when it is printed in just one color?

## Memorable:

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/04/19135329/memorable1.jpg)</figure>[](https://d3ui957tjb5bqd.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/09/memorable.jpg)  
Some logos are so iconic, that even toddlers can not only easily recall and recognize them but also figure out what the brand sells just by looking at the logo. This is exactly what a great logo is – memorable. Iconic logos invoke emotion and hence make a permanent impression in the minds of customers.

## Timeless:

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/04/19135349/timeless1.jpg)</figure>[](https://d3ui957tjb5bqd.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/09/timeless.jpg)  
Keep away from trends while designing a logo. An effective logo is traditional and timeless, not trendy. While creating a visual brand identity, its important to ensure that its effectiveness is long lasting.

## Conclusion

Finally, the K.I.S.S. (Keep it simple, stupid) approach is the way to go in logo design. Simple logos are incredibly effective, recognizable and versatile.

To summarize, here is a quote by Paul Rand, one of the world’s greatest designers:

> “A logo is a flag, a signature, an escutcheon, a street sign. A logo does not sell (directly), it identifies. A logo is rarely a description of a business. A logo derives meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around. A logo is less important than the product it signifies; what it represents is more important than what it looks like. The subject matter of a logo can be almost anything.”
