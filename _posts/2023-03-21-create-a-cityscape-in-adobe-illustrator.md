# CREATE A CITYSCAPE IN ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR

[ILLUSTRATOR TEMPLATE FILE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r2bzx848sapa4tq/cityscape-ai-files.zip?dl=0)

## General Setup

Below is an image that shows the general setup of the illustration. As you can see from the Layers panel, I’ve divided things up in stacking order, with the sky & ground as the bottom layer, and the bushes and the clouds in front as the top layers. When creating scenery like this, it’s a good thing to try to divide your layers up in stacking order. In this case, it’s easy to organize things per category (trees, houses, bushes…), and then also separate items in front from items that go in the back (e.g., background elements).

## Global Swatches

To turn a regular swatch into a Global Swatch, check the *Global* checkbox in the Swatch Options window that appears when you double-click a swatch. A Global Swatch is indicated by a white triangle in the bottom right corner of the swatch icon. The advantage is that any modifications to a Global Swatch automatically update all objects using that swatch.

---

## Create the Sky & Ground

### Step 1: Draw a green rectangle for the ground
Draw a horizontal green rectangle at the bottom of your document, using the horizontal guide as a reference.

![Draw a green rectangle at the bottom from left to right of your document using the horizontal guide as a reference.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130729/cityscape-illu-houses-1-2.png)

### Step 2: Draw a rectangle for the sky
Draw another rectangle right above the ground rectangle, filling the rest of the document. Apply a light blue gradient. With the rectangle still selected, go to *Object > Arrange > Send to Back*.

![Draw another rectangle right above for the sky using a light blue gradient.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130734/cityscape-illu-houses-2-2.png)

---

## The Houses

### Step 3: Create the walls
Draw a vertical rectangle and apply the yellow swatch.

![Create the walls](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130739/cityscape-illu-houses-3-4-2.png)

### Step 4: Copy & Paste in Front
Copy the rectangle, then paste it in front (*Cmd/Ctrl + F*). Move the pasted rectangle horizontally to align with the original rectangle's side and give it an 80% yellow fill.

---

### Step 5: Create the roof
Using the *Pen Tool*, add an anchor point at the top center of the copied rectangle. Drag this anchor point upwards using the *Direct Selection Tool* (white arrow) to form a 90° corner.

![Create the roof by adding an anchor point at the top center, and by moving it up.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130743/cityscape-illu-houses-5-6-2.png)

---

### Step 6: Draw the roof rectangle
Draw a smaller rectangle at the top of the house for the roof. Apply a darker orange as the fill.

![Finish the roof.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130747/cityscape-illu-houses-7-8-2.png)

---

### Step 7: Add a window
Draw a circular window on the house and apply the brown-gray fill with 20% opacity.

![Add the window and the door](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130751/cityscape-illu-houses-9-10-2.png)

---

### Step 8: Add a door
Create a vertical rectangle at the bottom of the house for the door. Use the darker green swatch, and then round the top corners using the *Live Corners* feature.

![Adjust the shape of the door and center align the window and the door with the front of the house](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130755/cityscape-illu-houses-11-12-2.png)

---

### Step 9: Duplicate the house
Group the house elements, then duplicate the house by dragging its group in the *Layers panel*. Adjust the new house's size, roof, colors, and side windows.

![Adjust the colors, and windows of the house to make it a different one.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130806/cityscape-illu-houses-16-2.png)

---

### Step 10: Add a garage
Draw additional rectangles to create a garage attached to the house. Use *Smart Guides* to align the shapes.

![Add the garage](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130838/cityscape-illu-houses-26-2.png)

---

### Step 11: Create additional houses
Repeat the techniques above to create more houses. Use *Copy*, *Reflect*, and *Align* tools to maintain consistency.

## Add small details to the houses

Attention to details is everything, so to finalize our houses, we add a few special details to some of them. This way they will stand out a little more, and it’ll add this little extra finesse to the illustration. To add these details always make sure to double click the (grouped) house first to go into *Isolation Mode*. This way the detail you’ll add to the house will also be part of the group.

### *28.* Add square detail to the front of the yellow house

On the yellow house I added a tiny square of **1 x 1px** on the right and used the *Transform effect* (*Effect &gt; Distort &amp; Transform &gt; Transform…*) to duplicate this square horizontally leaving some space in between each by moving it **4px** for **12** times. When applying these small details using the Transform effects, it’s good to keep in mind to use easy figures so you can do the math to achieve the effect you have in mind. To enter a specific value to the shapes you draw, you select the Rectangle or Ellipse tool, and click on the position you want the shape to appear. Then in the window that appears, you can enter the specific values and hit OK or enter. Once the object is placed, you can move it into position and apply the fill or stroke you like it to have and apply a repeating effect to it. Next are a couple of more examples to get you on your way.

![Add square detail on the yellow house, and an ornamental line below the roof on the bluish house](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130845/cityscape-illu-houses-28-29-2.png){:target="_blank"}

**Add square detail on the yellow house, and an ornamental line below the roof on the bluish house**

### *29.* Add ornamental line below the roof

On another house, I added an ornamental line. First, I drew a horizontal rectangle, and then on top to the left, I drew a small (almost square) rectangle, half overlapping the big horizontal rectangle. I selected the top anchor points of this small rectangle using the *Direct Selection tool* and made the corners fully round. Then I selected this shape and went to *Effect > Distort & Transform > Transform…* to move it **7px** horizontally **9** times in a row.

### *30.* Expand effect and apply Minus Front

Afterwards, I expanded this effect via *Object > Expand Appearance*. I selected both the big rectangle and all the smaller shapes. Then I selected the *Minus Front* option from the *Pathfinder* panel.

![Expand the effect, and choose Minus Front to create the rounded gaps. Create a vertical brick effect on the other bluish house.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130849/cityscape-illu-houses-30-31-2.png){:target="_blank"}

**Expand the effect, and choose Minus Front to create the rounded gaps. Create a vertical brick effect on the other bluish house.**

### *31.* Create a vertical brick effect

Here, I drew 2 small horizontal rectangles at the left border of the house. I selected both and duplicated them vertically **13x** leaving some room in between via *Effect > Distort & Transform > Transform…* as shown in the image above.

Feel free to use your creativity and add a couple more details on some other houses.

### Pine Trees

**1.** Create the left half of the first pine tree by drawing a rectangle and removing the top-left anchor point.

![Create the left half of the first pine tree by drawing a rectangle and removing the top-left anchor point, then vertical copy reflect](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130853/cityscape-illu-trees-and-green-1-2-2.png){:target="_blank"}

**2.** Copy reflect vertically to create the other side of the pine tree.

**3.** Apply color and draw the tree trunk.

![Apply color, add the trunk, align things up, and make it a Symbol](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130900/cityscape-illu-trees-and-green-3-4-2.png){:target="_blank"}

**4.** Make it a Symbol to easily reuse the tree in your landscape.

---

### Deciduous Trees

**5.** Draw the tree trunk and first branch.

**6.** Copy reflect the branch to the other side of the trunk.

**7.** Create the green part of the tree using overlapping circles and the *Unite* option in the *Pathfinder* panel.

![Create the green part of the tree, unite the shape, and apply a green gradient fill.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130910/cityscape-illu-trees-and-green-7-8-2.png){:target="_blank"}

---

### Bushes

**10.** Create a bush by drawing overlapping circles in different sizes, aligning them, and filling the bottom gaps using the *Pen tool*.

**11.** Unite the shapes and apply them as Symbols.

![Unite the shapes](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130923/cityscape-illu-trees-and-green-12-2.png){:target="_blank"}

---

### Skyline

**1.** Duplicate the houses layer and *Unite* them into one shape.

**2.** Adjust the rooftops to form a taller skyline.

---

### Clouds

**6.** Create and add clouds using overlapping circles, similar to the bushes technique.

![Create and add clouds using the same technique you've used to create the bushes.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21130958/cityscape-illu-skyline-6-2.png){:target="_blank"}

---

### Add a Clipping Mask

**7.** Create a Clipping Mask layer to frame the illustration.

**8.** Arrange layers to finalize the composition.

![Move all layers into place right below the Mask Layer so they become sublayers and the masking takes effect.](https://image-control-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/03/21131010/cityscape-illu-skyline-8-2.png)
