### Before you even create a New Document in  
InDesign, you should consider the end result.

What are you creating? Is it a book, brochure, newsletter, magazine? Will the document be printed in-house (i.e. on a basic PC printer) or will you be sending the document to a professional printer?

If you’re creating a print document for professional litho or digital printing, the printer will  
usually expect you, the designer, to prepare a document that is print- ready. This saves time and money, and also means that you effectively ‘lock’ your PDF print file once it’s sent on to the printer. Nobody can dip into your InDesign file and alter anything you wouldn’t want them to, mistakenly or otherwise. You should consider how your print-ready file should be prepared before you create a New Document in InDesign. You may want to get in touch with your printer before starting work to check their preferences for print-ready files. You can check a few things when you create your document to ensure you’ll end up with a print-ready document, prepped for export (see Page 13):

**Open inDesign** and either select **new Document** from the Welcome window, or go to **File &gt; new &gt; Document** from the menu at the top of your screen.

In the new **Document window**, ensure the <span style="color: #ff00ff;">**intent**</span> is set to **Print.**

You should also be sure to enter values for the Bleed if your document will have any colors, images, shapes or other elements which will cross the edge **(trim)** of the **Page.**

The **Bleed** is an extra space beyond the edge of the page which acts as a margin of error when the document is trimmed. To avoid a visible white line along the edge of your document, you should always include a bleed.

If you are creating a document where all the edges of the page will be visible on the final product (e.g. a poster, a business card or a folded brochure) you should set a bleed on all sides. If your document has an edge that will not be visible (e.g. a bound book, where the inside edge will be sucked into the binding), you should set a bleed on all sides except the **inside** edge.
